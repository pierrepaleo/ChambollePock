         phantom (n = 256, p_type = 'Modified Shepp-Logan', ellipses = None)

        Create a Shepp-Logan or modified Shepp-Logan phantom.

        A phantom is a known object (either real or purely mathematical)
        that is used for testing image reconstruction algorithms.  The
        Shepp-Logan phantom is a popular mathematical model of a cranial
        slice, made up of a set of ellipses.  This allows rigorous
        testing of computed tomography (CT) algorithms as it can be
        analytically transformed with the radon transform (see the
        function `radon').

        Inputs
        ------
        n : The edge length of the square image to be produced.

        p_type : The type of phantom to produce. Either
          "Modified Shepp-Logan" or "Shepp-Logan".  This is overridden
          if `ellipses' is also specified.

        ellipses : Custom set of ellipses to use.  These should be in
          the form
                [[I, a, b, x0, y0, phi],
                 [I, a, b, x0, y0, phi],
                 ...]
          where each row defines an ellipse.
          I : Additive intensity of the ellipse.
          a : Length of the major axis.
          b : Length of the minor axis.
          x0 : Horizontal offset of the centre of the ellipse.
          y0 : Vertical offset of the centre of the ellipse.
          phi : Counterclockwise rotation of the ellipse in degrees,
                measured as the angle between the horizontal axis and
                the ellipse major axis.
          The image bounding box in the algorithm is [-1, -1], [1, 1],
          so the values of a, b, x0, y0 should all be specified with
          respect to this box.

        Output
        ------
        P : A phantom image.

        Usage example
        -------------
          import matplotlib.pyplot as pl
          P = phantom ()
          pl.imshow (P)
